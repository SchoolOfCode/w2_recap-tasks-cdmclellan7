/* Task 4.1 - On your HTML page you will see an input field and an 'Add To List' button. Declare a new variable, 'importantThings',
as an empty array. Using JavaScript, configure the website so that when you write something in the input field and click the 
'Add To List' button, a new item is added to the 'importantThings' array. After adding an item to the 'importantThings' array, 
use the .map() method to generate and display an ordered list of the items on the page. Remember to break down the task and make 
a plan! */

/* Task 4.2 - Add a new label and input field element to your index.html file. This input field represents the priority value of your
important thing, and should be inputted as a number. Refactor your code so that, when you click your 'Add To List' button, you 
add list object to your array, rather than a string value. For example: 'let importantThings = [{text: 'telephone mother', priority: 1}]' 
Other than this change, the site should function exactly as it did before. */

/* Task 4.3 - Add a new button to your site called 'Order List'. Add an event listener to the button so that when it is clicked your list
is re-ordered by priority, where items with the lowest number (priority: 1) are displayed first. */
